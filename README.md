### 🏆 Featured Project

#### 🧠 [SSVEP Classification: FB-CCA vs Standard CCA](https://github.com/danylof/SSVEP-visual)
**Optimizing BCI performance with custom algorithm implementations.**
This project demonstrates the advantages of Filter Bank CCA (FB-CCA) over standard CCA for real-time BCI.
* **Key Innovation:** Developed a custom SVD-based CCA implementation that runs **14x faster** than `sklearn` (10ms vs 140ms per trial).
* **Results:** Achieved **+4% to +19% accuracy improvement** using optimal frequency sub-bands compared to standard methods.
* **Tech Stack:** Python (NumPy, SciPy, MNE), Signal Processing, Algorithm Optimization.
